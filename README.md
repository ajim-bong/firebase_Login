# firebase_Login

This is a login and Sign up system which I tried to implement using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase as the backend.
There are many features that I would have loved to include in this project like css effects and implementing a login system where user can  login and have
their credentials check in the database to see if they match

At the time of writting this readme file, I am still relatively new to programming 

so i am leaving this project for now and I'll move on to other things
